# citibike-challenge

For the Citibike challenge, I used the Jersey City data from the Citibike website, since there were fewer stations to deal with (and less data to slow things down).
Also, I used to work in Jersey City, so I found the area a litle more interesting to analyze.  I did want to include an entire year, but I did limit my analysis
to 2022.  I downloaded each month's files in csv format and used pandas to store each file as a dataframe, then concatenated the dataframes and exported back to
csv.  I then opened that csv in Tableau to perform the analsis.

If I had more time, I'd like to work with the previous years' data, even if it's only one month for each year, to try and determine:
- if electric bikes have become more popular over time
- if the top stations, in terms of ridership, have changed over time.

The main difficulty in this challenge was deciding which data to present and how to present it.  I had to try and limit myself and present only the data
I thought was critical for the end user to see.
